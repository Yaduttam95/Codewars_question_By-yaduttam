/*
You are given two huge numbers. 
Your job is to add them together.

Input: 
Two null terminated arrays of size 40 + the null terminator.

Output: 
A null terminated array of size 40 + the null terminator.

Details: 
The array contains numbers in ASCII 
format making up the hudge number. 
If the input would look like this 
n1 = "0000000000000000000000000000001234567890" 
and 
n2 = "0000000000000000000000000000001234567890" 
the output would be 
n = "0000000000000000000000000000002469135780"

Hint: 
Tthe numbers are in ascii format and to 
convert them to normal numbers you need 
to do this: n[i] -= '0'; and 
n[i] += '0'; to convert them back
