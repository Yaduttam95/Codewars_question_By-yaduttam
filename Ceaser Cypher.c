/*
   Ceasar's Cypher
Classic Crypto. Ceasar would send his 
generals encrypted messages using a 
simple ROT13 cypher. If the king of 
Rome can make this algorithm, so can you.

ROT13 rotates takes every letter and 
advances them 13 spaces in the alphabet.

a->n
b->o
c->p
...
z->m

Write a function that encrypts an 
ascii string with the ROT13 cypher.

This is a beginer's easy test, so 
for this one you don't have to worry 
about edge cases like bad inputs, 
capitalized letters, spaces, 
puntuaction, or unicode.

Bonus: try and make a program 
which turns the cypher back 
into plaintext.
