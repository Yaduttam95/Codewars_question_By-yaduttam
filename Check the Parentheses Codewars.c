    Check the Parentheses
Question:Most of nowaday calculators allow 
you to use parentheses so that you choose 
which calculations you want to give 
priority. So the dilemma is...

How does the calculator ‘know’ if 
parentheses are used appropriately?

Essentially, each time '(' is casted 
the user should eventually press ')' also.

The challenge i propose to you in this 
kata is that you build your own C 
function that can accomplish this fascinating task.

Example:

(2x +  1) + 3(dy/dx)+ 1 = 0

// this string as well placed parentheses
The function should be named checkParentheses(). 
If well written, when the differential equation 
above is inserted, the function must return 1.
